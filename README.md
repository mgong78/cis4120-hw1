# HW 1 (CIS 4120)

An HTML / CSS implementation of a weather app home screen based on feedback from user interviews.

External resources used for this project include code from this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76837048/creating-the-simplest-html-toggle-button. This toggle button, as well as the weather.com link and the horizontal scroll bar to view weather later in the day, are the features I implemented to completed the "interactivity" add-on.
